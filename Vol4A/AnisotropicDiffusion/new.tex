\objective{Demonstrate the use of finite difference schemes in image analysis.}

A common task in image processing is to remove extra static from an image.
This is most easily done by simply blurring the image, which can be accomplished by  treating the image as a rectangular domain and applying the diffusion (heat) equation:
\[u_t = c \Delta u\]
where $c$ is some diffusion constant and $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator.
Unfortunately, this also blurs the boundary lines between distinct elements of the image.

A more general form of the diffusion equation in two dimensions is:
\[u_t = \nabla\cdot \left( c(x,y,t) \nabla u \right)\]
where $c$ is a function representing the diffusion coefficient at each given point and time.
In this case, $\nabla \cdot$ is the divergence operator and $\nabla$ is the gradient. 

To blur a picture uniformly, choose $c$ to be a constant function.  
% , but we are often interested in \textit{preserving the edges} between features of the image.
Since $c$ controls how much diffusion is allowed at each point, it can be modified so that diffusion is minimized across edges in the image.
In this way we attempt to limit diffusion near the boundaries between different features of the image, and allow smaller details of the image (such as static) to blur away. 
This method for image denoising is especially useful for denoising low quality images, and was first introduced by Pietro Perona and Jitendra Malik in 1987.
It is known as Anisotropic Diffusion or Perona-Malik Diffusion.

\section*{A Finite Difference Scheme}
Suppose we have some estimate $E$ of the rate of change at a given point in an image.
$E$ will be largest at the boundaries in the image.
We will then let $c(x,y,t) = g(E(x,y,t))$ where $g$ is some function such that $g(0)=1$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = 0}$.
Thus $c$ will be small where $E$ is large, so that little diffusion occurs near the boundaries of different portions of the image.

We will model this system using a finite differencing scheme with an array of values at a 2D grid of points, and iterate through time.
Let $U_{l,m}^n$ be the discretized approximation of the function $u$, $n$ be the index in time, $l$ be the index along the $x$-axis, and $m$ be the index along the $y$-axis.

The Laplace operator can be approximated with the finite difference scheme
\[\Delta u = u_{xx}+u_{yy} \approx \frac{U_{l-1,m}^n - 2 U_{l,m}^n + U_{l+1,m}^n}{(\Delta x)^2} + \frac{U_{l,m-1}^n-2 U_{l,m}^n + U_{l,m+1}^n}{(\Delta y)^2}.\]
A good metric to use with images is to let the distance between each pixel be equal to one, so $\Delta x = \Delta y = 1$. 
Rearranging terms, we obtain
\[\Delta u \approx (U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) + (U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) + (U_{l,m-1}^n - U_{l,m}^n) + (U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n).\]
Again, since we are working with images and not some time based problem, we can without loss of generality let $\Delta t = 1$, so we obtain the finite difference scheme
\[U_{l,m}^{n+1} = U_{l,m}^n + (U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) + (U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) + (U_{l,m-1}^n - U_{l,m}^n) + (U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n).\]
We will now limit the diffusion near the edges of objects by making the modification
\begin{align*}
U_{l,m}^{n+1} = U_{l,m}^n + & \lambda \Big(g(|U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
			&+ g(|U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
			&+ g(|U_{l,m-1}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l,m-1}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
			&+ g(|U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n)\Big),
\end{align*}
where $\lambda \leq \frac{1}{4}$ is the stability condition. 

In this difference scheme, each term is affected most by nearby terms that are most similar to it, so less diffusion will happen anywhere there is a sharp difference between pixels.
This scheme also has the useful property that it does not increase or decrease the total brightness of the image.
Intuitively, this is because the effect of each point on its neighbors is exactly the opposite effect its neighbors have on it.

Two commonly used functions for $g$ are $g(x) = e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\sigma}\right)^2}$ and $g(x) = \frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{x}{\sigma}\right)^2}$.
The parameter $\sigma$ allows us to control how much diffusion decreases across boundaries, with larger $\sigma$ values allowing more diffusion.
Note that $g(0) = 1$ and $\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to \infty} g(x) = 0}$ for both functions.
In this lab we use $g(x)=e^{-\left(\frac{x}{\sigma}\right)^2}$.

It is worth noting that this particular difference scheme is \textit{not} an accurate finite difference scheme for the version of the diffusion equation we discussed before, but it \textit{does} accomplish the same thing in the same way.
As it turns out, this particular scheme is the solution to a slightly different diffusion PDE, but can still be used the same way.

For this lab's examples we read in the image using the \li{scipy.misc.imread} function, and normalized it so that the colors are represented as floating point values between 0 and 1.
An image can converted to black and white when it is read by including the argument \li{flatten=True}

Our finite difference scheme can be implemented using purely vector operations.
First consider the case where the boundaries of the image are considered fixed.
The scheme is implemented naively with the following code: 
\begin{lstlisting}
import numpy as np
from scipy.misc import imread, imsave
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import cm

def anisdiff_bw_noBCs(U, N, lambda_, g):
    """ Run the Anisotropic Diffusion differencing scheme
    on the array A of grayscale values for an image.
    Perform N iterations, use the function g
    to limit diffusion across boundaries in the image.
    Operate on A inplace. """
    for i in xrange(N):
        U[1:-1,1:-1] += lambda_ * \
                        (g(U[:-2,1:-1] - U[1:-1,1:-1]) *
                          (U[:-2,1:-1] - U[1:-1,1:-1]) +
                         g(U[2:,1:-1] - U[1:-1,1:-1]) *
                          (U[2:,1:-1] - U[1:-1,1:-1]) +
                         g(U[1:-1,:-2] - U[1:-1,1:-1]) *
                          (U[1:-1,:-2] - U[1:-1,1:-1]) +
                         g(U[1:-1,2:] - U[1:-1,1:-1]) *
                          (U[1:-1,2:] - U[1:-1,1:-1]))
\end{lstlisting}

We can implement anisotropic diffusion for black and white images using a different set of boundary conditions.
For the top edge let
\begin{align*}
U_{l,m}^{n+1} = U_{l,m}^n + & \lambda (g(|U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
					& + g(|U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
					& + g(|U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n));
\end{align*}
the other edges are treated similarly.
For the top left corner let
\begin{align*}
U_{l,m}^{n+1} = U_{l,m}^n + & \lambda (g(|U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
					& + g(|U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)(U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n)),
\end{align*}
and similarly for the other corners. 
Essentially we are just using the terms of the difference scheme that are actually defined.  

Here is a non-optimized implementation that performs the desired computations for a generic function $g$.
\begin{lstlisting}
def anisdiff_bw_withBCs(U, N, lambda_, g):
    """ Run the Anisotropic Diffusion differencing scheme
    on the array U of grayscale values for an image.
    Perform N iterations, use the function g
    to limit diffusion across boundaries in the image.
    Operate on U inplace. """
    difs = np.empty_like(U)
    for i in xrange(N):
        difs[:-1] = g(U[1:] - U[:-1]) * (U[1:] - U[:-1])
        difs[-1] = 0
        difs[1:] += g(U[:-1] - U[1:]) * (U[:-1] - U[1:])
        difs[:,:-1] += g(U[:,1:] - U[:,:-1]) * (U[:,1:] - U[:,:-1])
        difs[:,1:] += g(U[:,:-1] - U[:,1:]) * (U[:,:-1] - U[:,1:])
        difs *= lambda_
        U += difs
\end{lstlisting}

We can use this code on an image like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
from scipy.misc import imread, imsave
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import cm

# Read the image file 'test.png'.
# Multiply by 1. / 255 to change the values so that they are floating point
# numbers ranging from 0 to 1.
U = imread('test.jpg', flatten=True) * (1. / 255)
# Set inputs for the function.
sigma = .1
g = lambda x: np.exp(x * x * (-1. / sigma**2))
lambda_ = .25
N = 50
anisdiff_bw_noBCs(U, N, lambda_, g)
# Show the image.
plt.imshow(U, cmap=cm.gray)
plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{Speeding up the Implementation}
% Unfortunately, with reasonably sized images, this is still slow.
% This happens for a variety of reasons.
% When evaluating such a large vector expression, many temporary arrays are allocated and deallocated at each time step.
% As you can also see, there are many repeated computations.
% We do not need to calculate the differences between each point and the one next to it twice as we are doing here.
% We could also take advantage of the fact that the difference between values at each point is usually (except at the boundaries) used twice in two different terms.
% Each difference between pixels is used in the computations involving both of those pixels, once to find the right value of $g$ and once when we multiply by the value of $g$.
% To optimize these operations we could precompute the differences in each direction and use them more intelligently.
% The last issue is that, in performing these operations the way we do, we are not iterating over memory efficiently.
% To compute the value of this expression, the computer also must iterate many times over different blocks of memory.
% That also slows things down.
%
% Though this code is moderately fast, it is an example where NumPy operations with slicing are not quite enough.
% A partial solution would be to implement the same algorithm without using expressions that allocate temporary arrays.
% The best way to do this is with inplace operations.
% That will ensure that our code is not being slowed down by the costs from allocating and deallocating temporary arrays.
% We can also work to eliminate all duplicate computations in our difference scheme.
% Doing so gives us the following implementation of the same algorithm.
% Note! This is still not the simplest way to do this, but these are the sorts of operations that a student will want to understand to be able to code this algorithm well.

% \end{lstlisting}

% This is significantly faster, but much more messy.
% Unfortunately, there is still a significant speed loss from iterating over the arrays many more times than is actually necessary when performing computation.
% There is still a good way to address this problem.
% We can use the package numexpr to perform multiple computations on an array all at once.
We will use the package numexpr to speed up our computations. 
Numexpr is a package that can evaluate simple algebraic expressions involving arrays quickly by recognizing and computing common subexpressions and optimizing for fast cache management when accessing memory.
You may recall that the primary function in the user interface of numexpr is the \li{evaluate} function.
It evaluates an expression (in some cases, much faster than NumPy can) that has been expressed as a string containing the names of array objects that are in the current scope.
% Here is how this same algorithm can be written using numexpr.
Below we provide some example code that uses numexpr:
\begin{lstlisting}
import numpy as np
import numexpr as ne
x = np.arange(1000)
y = np.arange(1000,2000)

u = ne.evaluate('x**2. + y**2.')

This is both cleaner and faster than our previous solution.
It allows us to perform whole groups of operations together without having to iterate through memory over and over again.
It also optimizes for cache access so that memory bandwidth is best used.

Implement anisotropic diffusion (with the correct boundary conditions) using numexpr to optimize the computations.  How much speedup can you get over the unoptimized Numpy version? (Note: It is not difficult to speedup the Numpy implementation by reducing the need for Numpy to allocate space for temporary areas. However, we will use numexpr to speed up our implementation.)

\section*{Working with Color Images}

Colored images can be processed in a similar manner.
Instead of being represented as a two-dimensional array, colored images are represented as three dimensional arrays.
The third dimension is used to store the intensities of each of the standard 3 colors.
This diffusion process can be carried out in the exact same way, on each of the arrays of intensities for each color, but instead of detecting edges just in one color, we need to detect edges in any color, so instead of using something of the form $g(|U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n|)$ as before, we will now use something of the form $g(||U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n||)$, where $U_{l+1,m}^n$ and $U_{l,m}^n$ are vectors now instead of scalars.
The difference scheme can be treated as an equation on vectors in 3-space and now reads:
\begin{align*}
U_{l,m}^{n+1} = U_{l,m}^n + & \lambda (g(||U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n||)(U_{l-1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
					& + g(||U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n||)(U_{l+1,m}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
					& + g(||U_{l,m-1}^n - U_{l,m}^n||)(U_{l,m-1}^n - U_{l,m}^n) \\
					& + g(||U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n||)(U_{l,m+1}^n - U_{l,m}^n))
\end{align*}

When implementing this scheme for colored images, use the $2$-norm on 3-space, i.e $||x||=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2}$ where $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are the different coordinates of $x$.

We can use this function like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
A = imread('test.jpg') / np.float32(255.)
Ac = A.copy()
sigma = .1
lambda_ = .2
N = 5
anisdiff_color_noBCs(A, N, lambda_, sigma)
plt.imshow(A)
plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem}
Make a new version of the code you wrote for the previous problem which processes a colored image.
Measure the difference between pixels using the $2$-norm.
Use the corresponding vector versions of the boundary conditions given in Problem \ref{prob:anisdiff_bw}.

To do this, you must break up the computation of the different terms so that you can compute the norm along each triple of color values and then broadcast the g values along the last axis of the array of differences.


% Here is a reference implementation that you can use to verify that your optimized version is correct.

% This sort of anisotropic diffusion can be very effective, but, depending on the image, it may also smear out edges that do not have large differences between them.
% An example of this limitation can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:anisdif_smearing}

%
% As we can see, after 100 iterations, some of the boundaries between similar shades of grey have smeared unevenly. You may still have to look closely to see it.
% This can be counteracted somewhat by further decreasing the $\sigma$ value, but if we have random noise throughout the image, this will not remove it.
% If we have random static in the image, we can remove this using a modified version of the filter.
% Instead of measuring the rate of change in the picture in each direction, we change each point according to whether or not any of its adjacent points have roughly the same value it has.
% This is called a minimum-biased filter.
% This sort of trick is especially good for removing isolated pixels that are different from those around them.
% A very simple way to do this is by taking the average of the two smallest differences between each pixel and its eight neighbors and using that in place of $g$ in the difference scheme above.
% Along the boundaries, we do not have 8 neighbors for each pixel, but we can get by by just using the pixels we have and eliminating the other terms in the difference scheme, just as we did before.
% This will make it so that points that neighbor points of similar value will not be changed, while points that do not match their surroundings will be faded to become more like the points surrounding them.
% This does not have the same symmetrical diffusion as the other scheme, i.e. if one pixel changes, it does not necessarily change its neighboring pixels by the same amount.
% As long as you leave $\lambda \leq \frac{1}{4}$ and you have scaled the pixels to have floating point values between 0 and 1, the scheme will still remain within its minimum and maximum bounds, since the tendency is always to move points closer to the values of their neighbors.
% To demonstrate the action of such a filter, we make changes to random pixels in the color version of the same photo and use both filters to remove the noise we have added.
% Below, we include an example where we have added noise to the color version of that same picture, then used a minimum-biased filter to diminish the noise and the original filter to smooth what remains.
