People were categorized in different ways, from health, diet and physical activity, and their weight changes were recorded over time.  Making no claims about causation, this paper reports that healthy and normal weighted people had, in general, different habits than those who were heavy, or got heavy over the course of the study, thus suggesting some further areas of research, and possible strategies for better weight management.  For example, a regular diet including fruit, vegetables, yogurt and nuts were more highly correlated (not surprisingly) with healthier people.  This paper is largely confirmatory with conventional wisdom, with the possible exception of the correlation found between normal weighted people and regular consumption of nuts and yogurt, which may be viewed by many as less healthy due to their higher levels of fat.}

  annote={This paper describes the results of the National Weight Control Registry.  Successful long-term weight loss maintainers (average weight loss of 30 kg for an average of 5.5 years) share common behavioral strategies, including eating a diet low in fat, frequent self monitoring of body weight and food intake, and high levels of regular physical activity. Weight loss maintenance may get easier over time. Once these successful maintainers have maintained a weight loss for 2–5 years, the chances of longer-term success greatly increase.}

  annote={This paper examines the success rate for dieters.  There is a long-standing statistic that 95\% of people who lose weight gain it back--this oft-cited statistic has been credited to Albert Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania and a director emeritus of the AOA. Stunkard reported the 95\% failure based on a study he did in 1959, which involved advising 100 overweight patients.  In this more recent paper, the failure rate for long-term weight loss is more carefully examined, and it was found that the success rate was roughly 20\%, where success is defined by losing 10\% of ones weight and keeping it off for a year or more.},
