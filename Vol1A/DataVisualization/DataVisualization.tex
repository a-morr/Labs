\section*{The Importance of Visualizations} % =================================

Using visualizations to understand data often reveals insights that may not immediately obvious from simple statistics.
The following data set, known as \emph{Anscombe's quartet}, is a famous example of the importance of graphing data.

Each section of Anscombe's quartet the following statistical properties:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
\item The means are $9$ for $x$ and $7.5$ for $y$.
\item The sample variances are $11$ for $x$ and $3.75$ for $y$.
\item The correlation between $x$ and $y$ is $.816$.
\item The linear least squares regression line is $y=\frac{1}{2}x+3$.
\end{itemize}

Despite these similarities, each section is quite different from the others.

\section*{Principles of Good Data Visualization} % ============================

Problem \ref{prob:anscombes-quartet} demonstrate how visualizations can describe data much more accurately than simple statistics.
However, a poor or unethical visualizations can easily misrepresent data.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clarity}: Use titles, label axes, and include a legend. Graphs should be self-explanatory.
    Where appropriate, use words to carefully explain the insights represented
    in the visualization.
    \item \textbf{Simplicity}: Remove unnecessary elements of a graph.
    Don't add 3D effects in for no reason.
    \item \textbf{Integrity}. Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

    Every visualization should be presented alongside all relevant information including who created it, where the data was obtained, how it was collected, whether it was cleaned or transformed, and whether there are conflicts of interest or possible biases present.

    It is almost always very easy to manipulate a visualization so that it supports a desired interpretation.



    As in any form of communication, integrity is important in data visualization.


\end{enumerate}

\section*{Choosing the Right Visualization} % =================================

Most data sets are more naturally described with one type of visualization than another.
Below we review several common visualizations, their standard usages, and questions to consider during their construction.

\small{ % Get this section to fit on one page.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Line Plot}: Connects ordered $(x,y)$ points with straight lines.

Used to visualize one or two ordered arrays, such as functional outputs over an ordered domain or a sequence of values over time.
%
\begin{itemize}
    % \item What do the axes represent? How should they be labeled?
    \item Are linear or logarithmic scales more effective?
    \item Is the line an appropriate thickness and color?
\end{itemize}

% Use \li{plt.plot()} to create a line plot.

\item \textbf{Scatter Plot}: Draws $(x,y)$ points without connecting them.

Best for displaying points without a natural order or where each point is an individual instance and not inherently related to the other points in the set.
%
\begin{itemize}
    % \item What do the axes represent? How should they be labeled?
    \item Which marker is most appropriate?
    \item Are the markers an appropriate size and color?
\end{itemize}

% Use \li{plt.plot()} with a point marker (\li{'.'}, \li{','}, \li{'o'}, etc.) or \li{plt.scatter()} to draw a scatter plot.

\begin{comment} % Window size, also should go later (with ethics).
Figure \ref{fig:scatter_correlation} displays two scatter plots.
The first appears to have a weak correlation and the second appears to have a strong correlation.
However, the same data is being plotted and the only difference is the scale and window size.
Manipulating these can change your interpretation and should be done with careful consideration.
\end{comment}

\item \textbf{Histogram}: Partitions an interval into a number of bins and counts the number of values that fall into each bin.

Best for visualizing a single unordered array, such as draws from a probability distribution.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item How many bins should be used?
    \item Over what range should the bins be?
    \item Is a linear or a logarithmic scale more appropriate for the frequency axis?
\end{itemize}

% Use \li{plt.hist()} to create a histogram.
% The arguments \li{bins} and \li{<<range>>} specify the number of bins to draw and over what domain.

\begin{comment} % Details for later.
A histogram with only a few bins or too many bins will fail to give a clear view of the distribution of the data, therefore it is important to choose the number of bins that gives the best view of the distribution of the data.

Similarly, reference lines are distracting and focus on unnecessary details instead of the shape of the distribution.
If more precise details are desired, exact figures can be presented alongside the histogram in a table.
\end{comment}

\item \textbf{Heat Map}: Assigns a color to each point on a 2-D domain, providing a 2-D picture representing a 3-D surface.

Best for visualizing functions $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, usually over a domain constructed with \li{np.meshgrid()}.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is the domain sufficiently refined?
    \item Which color scheme is most clear and effective?
    \item Is a linear or a logarithmic scale more appropriate for the color?
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Contour Map}: Draws level curves of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$.

A filled contour map is discretized version of a heat map.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item How many / which contour lines should be drawn?
    % \item Is the color scheme clear and effective?
    \item Is a linear or a logarithmic scale more appropriate for the color?
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}}

\subsection*{Scatter Plots} % -------------------------------------------------

\begin{comment}
% Example of using a marker and a line.
Line plots and scatter plots are sometimes used together.
A line connecting points implies a relationship or correlation between the points, while drawing point markers emphasizes that each point is a unique instance of data.
Use \li{plt.plot()} and specify a marker \emph{and} a line style in the third argument to do both at once.
% The keywords \li{linewidth} (or \li{ls}) and \li{markersize} (or \li{ms}) control the thickness of the line and the size of the markers, respectively.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> x = np.linspace(0, 4, 8)
>>> data = x**2

>>> plt.subplot(131)                # Regular line plot of the data.
>>> plt.plot(x, data, 'b-', linewidth=2)

>>> plt.subplot(132)                # Scatter plot of the data.
>>> plt.plot(x, data, 'g.', markersize=15)

>>> plt.subplot(133)                # Line and scatter plot.
>>> plt.plot(x, data, 'r.-', linewidth=2, markersize=15)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{comment}

% Explain plt.scatter(), especially the 'c' and 's' keyword arguments.
While \li{plt.plot()} is an easy way to create scatter plots, \li{plt.scatter()} provides a few extra tools.
The keywords \li{s} and \li{c} correspond to marker size and marker color, respectively.
Each keyword can either be a single entry, producing uniform markers, or an array, specifying the sizes or colors of the individual markers.
This allows a scatter plot to have up to four dimensions of information.

Consider again Anscombe's quartet.
The pattern in section II can be made more pronounced by tying the size of the marker to the value of the $y$ coordinate.
Since adjusting the size of the markers may lead to overlapping markers, we specify the \emph{alpha value} of the color to make the markers transparent.
The keyword \li{alpha} accepts a value in the interval $[0,1]$; 0 makes the markers completely transparent, while a $1$ makes the markers completely opaque.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> anscombe = np.load("anscombe.npy")
>>> x2, y2 = anscombe[:,2], anscombe[:,3]

>>> plt.subplot(121)
>>> plt.scatter(x2, y2, c='b', s=500)

>>> plt.subplot(122)
>>> plt.scatter(x2, y2, c='b', s=.5*y**4, alpha=.8)

>>> plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

Controlling the colors of the individual markers can also be illuminating. % TODO: The goal is to present 3-dimensional data, not show patterns...
As with heat maps and contour plots, a color bar can be added to indicate the values that the colors represent.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> x3, y3 = anscombe[:,4], anscombe[:,5]

>>> plt.subplot(121)
>>> plt.scatter(x3, y3, s=500, c='b')

>>> plt.subplot(122)
>>> plt.scatter(x, y, s=500, c=y, alpha=.8)
>>> cbar = plt.colorbar()           # Draw and label the color bar.
>>> cbar.set_label("y")

% Talk about connecting the dots, then using a regression line instead.

\begin{problem} % Scatter plots with visualizations.
The file \texttt{MLB.npy} contains measurements from over 1,000 recent Major League Baseball players, compiled by UCLA.\footnote{See \url{http://wiki.stat.ucla.edu/socr/index.php/SOCR_Data_MLB_HeightsWeights}.}
Each row in the array represents a different player; the columns are the player's height (in inches), weight (in pounds), and age (in years), in that order.

Describe the data with at least one visualization.
Your graph(s) should demonstrate whether height, weight, or age correlated with each other in the MLB.
\end{problem}

\subsection*{Histograms} % ----------------------------------------------------

Line plots should \emph{not} be used for data without a natural progression.
For example, suppose we would like to make a large number of random draws from a distribution to visualize its probability density function.
In this case, a plain line plot is completely useless, but the histogram provides an accurate picture of the statistical distribution.

\begin{comment}
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Get 10,000 random samples from the standard normal distribution.
>>> data = np.random.normal(size=10000)

>>> plt.subplot(121)                # Regular line plot of the data.
>>> plt.plot(data)

>>> plt.subplot(122)                # Histogram of the data.
>>> plt.hist(data, bins=30)

>>> plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\end{comment}

Less is more.
In the case of a statistical distribution, all we really want to see is the general shape of the distribution.
The lines separating the bins, axis tick marks, and even the labels on the $y$ axis are all unnecessary (and potentially distracting) details.

Removing the lines between bins is easy: set the line width to $0$.
To ensure the gaps where the lines used to be are filled, specify the \li{histtype} as \li{"stepfilled"} (using \li{histtype="step"} will draw the outline without filling it in).
Finally, to get rid of extra markings on the axes, use \li{plt.tick_params()}.
Some of this function's keyword arguments are summarized below.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{r|c|l}
    \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Argument} & Options & \multicolumn{1}{|c}{Description}
    \\ \hline
    \li{axis} & \li{'x'}, \li{'y'}, \li{"both"} & Axis on which to operate. \\

A histogram plots an array of values against the frequency with which the values occur.
To plot a line plot of values against frequency (without drawing a histogram), use \li{np.histogram()}.
This function returns the number of values in each bin and the locations of the edges of the bins.
Use the edges of the bins to calculate the center of the bins, then use a line plot to connect the two.

\begin{lstlisting}
# Get samples from a beta distribution and draw its PDF.
>>> for i, N in enumerate([10000, 10000000]):
...     plt.subplot(1,2,i+1)
...     data = np.random.beta(a=5, b=2, size=N)
...     # Draw a line plot using the bin centers and frequencies.
...     frequencies, bin_edges = np.histogram(data, bins=50)
...     bin_centers = (bin_edges[:-1] + bin_edges[1:])/2.
...     plt.plot(bin_centers, frequencies, 'b-', lw=4)
...     # Plot the faded histogram for comparison.
...     plt.hist(data, bins=50, alpha=.1)
...     plt.tick_params(axis="both", which="both", labelleft='off',
...                                  left="off", top="off", right="off")

\begin{problem} % Earthquake data
The file \texttt{earthquakes.npy} contains data from the 17,065 earthquakes between 2000 and 2010 that were at least a 5 on the Richter scale.\footnote{See \url{http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/}.}
Each row in the array represents a different earthquake;
the columns are the earthquake's date (as a fraction of the year), magnitude, longitude, and latitude, in that order.

Because each earthquake is a distinct event, a good way to start visualizing this data might be a scatter plot of the years versus the magnitudes of each earthquake.

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> year, magnitude, longitude, latitude = np.load("earthquakes.npy").T
>>> plt.plot(year, magnitude, '.')
>>> plt.xlabel("Year")
>>> plt.ylabel("Magnitude")
>>> plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[H] % Bad visualization: earthquake data, year vs magnitude.
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figures/earthquake.pdf}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, this plot communicates very little information because the data is so cluttered.
Describe the data with two or three better visualizations.
Your graphs should clearly answer the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many earthquakes happened every year?
    \item How often do stronger earthquakes happen compared to weaker ones?
    \item Where do earthquakes happen? Where do the strongest earthquakes happen?
\end{enumerate}
% (Hint: \li{plt.gca().set_aspect("equal")} fixes the aspect ratio, which may improve comparisons between longitude and latitude.)
\end{problem}

% Consider Figure \ref{fig:logexample} which shows data about large earthquakes from the United States Geological Survey.
% It appears to be somewhat random however, when transformed, the frequency of the magnitudes on a logarithmic scale show a fairly strong linear relationship between the variables.

\label{fig:contour}
\end{figure}

Three-dimensional data can be displayed with a contour plot.
This draws lines in the plane where the third value is constant---like a topographical map.
Coloring the space between the contour lines produces a heat map.
Heat maps work best when only one or two colors are used.

    $z = \sin(x)\sin(y)$ on the domain $[-1,4] \times [-4,1]$.
The plot on the left uses a rainbow gradient, which has no meaningful relationship to the data.
The plot on the right uses the colormap \li{afmhot}.  The lighter and darker colors are a more intuitive
representation of higher and lower values.}

\label{fig:heatmap}
\end{figure}

% TODO: In the next release of Matplotlib (version 2.0) viridis is the default.
% TODO: Reword (awkward).
A good default colormap is Matplotlib's \li{viridis}.
Other colormaps that are appropriate for the data can be selected using the argument \li{cmap='NAME\_OF\_COLORMAP'}, where \li{NAME\_OF\_COLORMAP} is one of Matplotlib's sequential or diverging colormaps.
Two sequential colormaps are \li{afmhot} and \li{cool}. Two diverging colormaps are \li{seismic} and \li{bwr}.
These colormaps along with their color scheme can be found on
\url{http://matplotlib.org/examples/color/colormaps_reference.html}.
Although three-dimensional data can be plotted as a surface in 3-space, it is often difficult to find a view where none of the important features of the data are obscured.
A heatmap avoids this problem and is easier to understand.

You can create a contour plot in Matplotlib with \li{plt.contour()}.

You can also create a pseudocolor plot in Matplotlib with the \li{plt.pcolormesh()} command.

Scatter plots may reveal insights other than correlation.
Consider Figure \ref{fig:scatterquake} which plots earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
The USGS data began including earthquakes with magnitude 6.5 or greater; this is clearly seen
in the scatter plot of the entire dataset.
Plots like this may also reveal errors in the dataset that are harder to detect in a table of values.

\begin{comment} % This needs to go somewhere else.
Understanding a data set through visualizations is an iterative process.
Start with an initial visualization---usually a broad overview---and examine the data, then adjust the visualization or create other visualizations based on what you observe.
Ask the following questions as you search for insights:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Does the data make sense?
\item Would a different visualization communicate more information?
\item Would visualizing a subset of the data provide more information?
\item Would transforming the data reveal a hidden pattern?
\end{enumerate}
\end{comment}

As in any form of communication, integrity is important in data visualization.
Every visualization should be presented alongside all relevant information including who created it, where the data was obtained, how it was collected, whether it was cleaned or transformed, and whether there are conflicts of
interest or possible biases present.
Where appropriate, use words to carefully explain the insights represented
in the visualization.
These practices will help the reader correctly interpret the visualization.

\subsection*{Things to Avoid} % -----------------------------------------------

Some popular visualizations (pie charts, radar graphs, stacked bar charts and others) interfere with our ability to interpret the information they display.
For example, it is more difficult to detect differences in a pie chart than on a bar chart with the same data.
This is because differences in area are more difficult to detect than differences in length.
As a result, charts that depend on detecting variation in area will be less effective.
Instead, choose visualizations that compare the data to the a simple standard that is easy to understand and interpret.
Figures \ref{fig:pievsbar} and \ref{fig:stacked} are examples of poorly chosen visualizations.

\begin{figure} % Bad graphs.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{A pie chart on the left that has been improved by a transformation into a bar chart on the right.}
\label{fig:pievsbar}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Keep It Simple} % ------------------------------------------------

It may be tempting to stylize your visualization by adding icons and pictures or by making certain features
look 3D.  This is called chartjunk, a term coined by Edward Tufte. Chartjunk is anything in a plot that fails to add to or
misrepresents the data.  Avoid making visualizations that are overly fancy or cluttered with chartjunk. This
includes 3D effects (as in \ref{fig:pievsbar}), bad font choices, and unnecessary icons and pictures.
Visualizations are at their best when they are as simple as possible and allow the reader to easily
interpret the information being presented.

Reference lines can distract from the visualization (see Figure \ref{fig:histogram}).
For example, we can remove axis lines, tick marks, and bar lines
with the following code:

\begin{lstlisting}
# Get current axis instance
axis = plt.gca()

# Hide top and right spines
axis.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
axis.spines['top'].set_visible(False)

# Only show bottom and left tick marks
axis.yaxis.set_ticks_position('left')
axis.xaxis.set_ticks_position('bottom')
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem} % Problem: convert a pie chart to a horizontal bar chart.
Regraph the pie chart in Figure \ref{fig:pievsbar} as a horizontal bar chart using the follwing data.

\label{fig:stacked}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Small Multiples} % -----------------------------------------------

When we have too much information to display cleanly in one chart, we can split the visualization into many smaller visualizations and place them near each other so they can be easily compared.
This method is called \emph{small multiples} and was made famous by Edward Tufte.

As an example, consider the first six Chebyshev polynomials.
Plotting them all on the same graph makes the visualization cluttered.
Instead, each polynomial can be given its own graph and laid out in a way that makes them easy to compare, (see Figure \ref{fig:PoT}).

% add more reference material??

\begin{figure} % Chebyshev polynomials

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Chebyshev polynomials graphed together on the left and in small multiples on the right.
The small multiples are much easier to interpret.}
\label{fig:PoT}
\end{figure}

To make small multiples, use the Matplotlib command \li{ax = plt.subplot()} which sets up multiple plots one at a time.
% Some example code is provided below.

\begin{lstlisting}
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from numpy.polynomial import Chebyshev as T

def Chebyshev_subplots():
    fig = plt.figure(dpi=100)
    fig.set_size_inches(10,10)
    fig.suptitle('Chebyshev Polynomials', fontsize=20)

    x = np.linspace(-1,1,500)

    for i in range(9):
        ax = plt.subplot(3,3,i+1)
        ax.plot(x, T.basis(i)(x), lw=2, label="$T_%d$"%i)
        plt.xlim(-1.1,1.1)
        plt.ylim(-1.1,1.1)
        ax.set_title('$T_%d$'%i)
        if i%3:
            # remove the inner y-ticks and labels.
            ax.set_yticklabels([])
            ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('none')
        if i<6:
            # remove the inner x-ticks and labels.
            ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('none')
            ax.set_xticklabels([])

    plt.show()
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{problem} % Problem: plot the Bernstein polynomials.
The $n+1$ Bernstein basis polynomials of degree $n$ are defined as

$$b_{v,n} = {{n} \choose {v}} x^v (1-x)^{n-v}, v = 0, 1,..., n.$$

Plot the Bernstein basis polynomials for $v,n$ in [0,3] as small multiples and compare that to the cluttered version of plotting them on top of each other.

\subsection*{Additional Material} % ===========================================

There are many software packages that facilitate the visual exploration of data.
One Python library is Glue (see \cite{glue}).

Some packages for making nicer looking plots include \li{Seaborn} and \li{prettyplotlib}.  TODO get refs

\textbf{Bar Chart}: Best for small sets of discrete, one-dimensional, categorical data.
Usually, a horizontal bar chart is preferred over a vertical bar chart because it's harder to read vertical labels than horizontal labels.
Also, horizontal labels on a vertical bar chart may not fit on the graph well (see Figure \ref{fig:barchart}).

The data in a bar chart should be sorted in a logical way.
If the chart is being used to compare the values of different data points, it is best to sort by size; if the chart is being used to look up specific values, the labels should be sorted in a way that makes it easy to find specific values (for example, alphabetically).
Use \li{plt.bar()} or \li{plt.barh()} to create a bar chart in Matplotlib.
